# Bank-Marketing-Recommendation

A recommendation model for a bank direct marketing call center. The goal is to predict which costumers will purchase a bond suggested by a phone caller.
Our aim in this projects was to find the best model that will ensure minimal amount of phone calls to reduce call center costs, while still having a large conversion  rate.
